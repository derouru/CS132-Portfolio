              <p>Gender bias strengthens the lack of institutionalized support for discrimination against women in the labor force.</p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl py-4 font-medium text-center text-fuchsia-300">What's our objective?</h3>
                <p>Use data science to study patterns and trends in the participation of women in the labor force, and propose solutions related to gender diversity and inclusion in the labor force.</p>

        <p class="my-4">
          Clearly, the issue lies in pervasive, discriminatory gender norms, which are behind the gender gap in the labor force despite women being as competent and employable as men.
          In an attempt to paint a better picture of how discrimination has affected opportunities for women to work, our group will investigate the gender gap present in the labor force.

        <p class="py-8 text-3xl font-medium text-center">Through data analysis, we aim to answer the following questions:</p> 
        <p  class="text-3xl py-4 font-medium text-center ">Q1: What jobs under the labor force do women take the most?</p>
        <p  class="text-3xl py-4 font-medium text-center ">Q2: Over the years, what factors correlate significantly with lack of women employment?</p>

            <h3 class="text-3xl">Null Hypothesis</h3>
            <p class="text-center text-fuchsia-300">There are no identifiable work types where women are more outnumbered. Additionally, there is no significant relationship between certain factors (e.g. region, relationship with house head, educational attainment, etc.) and the gender gap between men and women in the labor force.</p>

            <p class="text-center p-5 text-fuchsia-300">There are job types with a more prevalent gender gap, where women are significantly outnumbered and less likely to be found participating in. There are also identifiable factors that closely correlate with the gap between men and women in the labor force.</p>

          <p>We analyzed data from factors affecting bias in recruitment, opportunities, and participation of women in the labor force.</p>
