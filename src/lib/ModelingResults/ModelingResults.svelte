    <!--INSERT GRAPH2-->
    <!--INSERT GRAPH3-->
    <p class="text-left">The t-tests were able to identify that there is a significant gender gap among those employed with a household size of 2 (p = 0.0366) and 5 (p = 0.0367)--women are severely outnumbered in these categories. As for the rest of the household sizes, the analysis yielded no significant findings. This could be attributed to the fact that 2 and 5 are more common household sizes, with the average national household size being 4.1. </p>
